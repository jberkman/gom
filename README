Gom

Gom allows you to write GTK applications using JavaScript and an
HTML-like widget layout syntax.

It does this by first implementing a W3C DOM Level 1 (Core) API for
interacting with GTK widgets and windows, then by providing a
JavaScript binding to this layer.

Those are the goals, at any rate.  It is certainly a work in progress;
basically examples/hello.gom works and probably not much more.

Gom is on the Web!

To build Gom, you need to check out and build Mozilla's JavaScript
engine - SpiderMonkey.  Instructions are here:

http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SpiderMonkey_Build_Documentation

Don't worry, it is a small amount of code and should build easily and
quickly.

When running Gom's configure script, you should point it at your
mozilla checkout using the --with-mozilla-source=<path> option.

Once you've build gom, you can pass a .gom file to load on the command
line:

$ ./gom examples/hello.gom

It will spew a bunch of garbage to the command line, but if all goes
well a window will pop up.  Close the window with your windowmanager,
and gom should exit.
